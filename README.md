# Blackjack Game

## Objective

This is one of my earliest projects using JavaScript, where I aimed to create a visually appealing interactive game of Blackjack. Later on, when I learned about web APIs I decided I wanted to incorporate the card properties in the game to enhance the design and challenge myself to refactor the code.

## My Stack

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as the Deck of Cards API to enhance a project that I built on Scrimba's learning platform.

## Accomplishments 

This was my first solo effort at fetching data from an API to incorporate into a simpler project. I'm really happy with how it turned out.

## Challenges 

## Things to Revisit
 
I want to review the code and make sure that I am using best practices for web accessibility.
